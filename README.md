## Comparison of CNN for MNIST and notMNIST data

*A comparision of two recurrent neural networks that are optimized for slightly different datasets (MNIST and notMNIST). Model 1 is optimized for MNIST, and model 2 is optimized for notMNIST. Both models are fit to both sets of data, and training times, accuracy, and errors are compared.*

#### Model 1 (optimized for MNIST)

#### Model 2 (optimized for nonMNIST)
